            "whatYouWillLearn": "Join the most comprehensive Node.js course on Udemy and learn Node in both a practical and a theory-based way!\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nNode.js is probably THE most popular and modern server-side programming language you can learn these days!\r\n\r\nNode.js developers are in high demand and the language is used for everything from traditional web apps with server-side rendered views over REST APIs all the way up to GraphQL APIs and real-time web services. Not to mention its applications in build workflows for projects of all sizes.\r\n\r\nThis course will teach you all of that! From scratch with zero prior knowledge assumed. Though if you do bring some knowledge, you'll of course be able to quickly jump into the course modules that are most interesting to you.\r\n\r\nHere's what you'll learn in this course:\r\n\r\nNode.js Basics & Basic Core Modules\r\n\r\nParsing Requests & Sending Responses\r\n\r\nRendering HTML Dynamically (on the Server)\r\n\r\nUsing Express.js\r\n\r\nWorking with Files and generating PDFs on the Server (on-the-fly)\r\n\r\nFile Up- and Download\r\n\r\nUsing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern\r\n\r\nUsing Node.js with SQL (MySQL) and Sequelize\r\n\r\nUsing Node.js with NoSQL (MongoDB) and Mongoose\r\n\r\nWorking with Sessions & Cookies\r\n\r\nUser Authentication and Authorization\r\n\r\nSending E-Mails\r\n\r\nValidating User Input\r\n\r\nData Pagination\r\n\r\nHandling Payments with Stripe.js\r\n\r\nBuilding REST APIs\r\n\r\nAuthentication in REST APIs\r\n\r\nFile Upload in REST APIs\r\n\r\nBuilding GraphQL APIs\r\n\r\nAuthentication in GraphQL APIs\r\n\r\nFile Upload in GraphQL APIs\r\n\r\nBuilding a Realtime Node.js App with Websockets\r\n\r\nAutomated Testing (Unit Tests)\r\n\r\nDeploying a Node.js Application\r\n\r\nUsing TypeScript with Node.js\r\n\r\nExploring Deno.js\r\n\r\nAnd Way More!\r\n\r\nDoes this look like a lot of content? It certainly is!\r\n\r\nThis is not a short course but it is the \"Complete Guide\" on Node.js after all. We'll dive into a lot of topics and we'll not just scratch the surface.\r\n\r\nWe'll also not just walk through boring theory and some slides. Instead, we'll build two major projects: An online shop (including checkout + payments) and a blog.\r\n\r\nAll topics and features of the course will be shown and used in these projects and you'll therefore learn about them in a realistic environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs this course for you?\r\n\r\nIf you got no Node.js experience, you'll love this course because it starts with zero knowledge assumed. It's the perfect course to become a Node.js developer.\r\n\r\nIf you got basic Node.js experience, this course is also a perfect match because you can go through the basic modules quickly and you'll benefit from all the deep dives and advanced topics the course covers.\r\n\r\nAre you an advanced Node.js user? Check the curriculum then. Maybe you found no other course that shows how to use SQL with Node.js. Or you're interested in GraphQL. Chances are, that you'll get a lot of value out of this course, too!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrerequisites\r\n\r\nNO Node.js knowledge is required at all!\r\n\r\nNO other programming language knowledge (besides JavaScript, see next point) is required\r\n\r\nBasic JavaScript knowledge is assumed though - you should at least be willing to pick it up whilst going through the course. A JS refresher module exists to bring you up to the latest syntax quickly\r\n\r\nBasic HTML + CSS knowledge helps but is NOT required\r\n\r\nWho this course is for:\r\nBeginner or advanced web developers who want to dive into backend (server-side) development with NodeJS\r\nEveryone who's interested in building modern, scalable and high-performing web applications\r\nExperienced NodeJS developers who want to dive into specific features like using GraphQL with NodeJS",
